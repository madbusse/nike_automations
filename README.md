# Nike Social Automations
Check out some sneak peaks of solutions I've built to automate marketing operations at Nike. I can't share all the code, but here's the gist of what I work on!

## 🗓️ YoY Comps via Black Friday Calendar
Typical data platforms only allow daily YoY comparisons to be made to the same calendar date last year. However, in the marketing industry, where Q4 revolves around Black Friday but Black Friday falls on a different date each year, it doesn't make sense to compare by date. In order to give media coordinators insight into how campaigns are performing relative to last year, I created a Python program that leverages pandas and the datetime library to build a retail calendar centered around Black Friday.

## 📊 Jordan Data Reporter
Dashboards are so last year! I leveraged pandas to create Python script that goes straight from raw data to insights, delivering crucial metrics to the analyst so that she can write weekly reports without wasting any time manually pulling numbers.

## 📱 Snapchat Auto-Bidder
Automatically updates bid micros (for those with marketing familiarity, these are a different thing than bid modifiers) in-platform by pulling data from a spreadsheet.
